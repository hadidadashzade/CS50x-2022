### 📄 Description

This week introduced the fundamentals of **C programming**, including:

- Functions and return values  
- Conditions (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Variables and data types  
- Input validation  

As part of the **CS50x 2022** curriculum, I completed the following problems:

1. **Hello** – My first C program that prints “hello, world”.
2. **Mario (Less)** – Prints a half-pyramid of hashes based on user input.
3. **Cash** – Uses a greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum number of coins needed for change.
4. **Mario (More)** – [Not Completed] Prints a full pyramid with two sides.
5. **Credit** – [Not Completed] Validates credit card numbers using Luhn’s Algorithm.
