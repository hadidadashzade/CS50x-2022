## Week 3 – Algorithms (CS50x 2022)

🟡 This is part of my journey through CS50x 2022.  
✔️ Completed problems are checked.  
🔜 Remaining ones may be added in the future.

### ✅ Achievements

- [x] Plurality  
- [x] Runoff  
- [ ] Tideman  
- [ ] Lab 3: Sort  

### 📄 Description

In **Week 3**, the focus was on fundamental **algorithms** related to voting systems and sorting. Key concepts covered:

- Implementation of plurality voting system  
- Runoff voting system mechanics  
- Tideman ranked pairs method (not completed)  
- Sorting algorithms explored in Lab 3 including Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Merge Sort (pending)  

Completed problems:

1. **Plurality** – A basic voting system where the candidate with the most votes wins.  
2. **Runoff** – A voting system that allows for runoff rounds when no candidate has a majority.

Incomplete or pending problems:

3. **Tideman** – Implementation of Tideman ranked pairs voting method.  
4. **Lab 3: Sort** – Analysis of sorting algorithms via provided programs (Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort).
